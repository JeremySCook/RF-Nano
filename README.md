# RF-Nano
Library for RF-Nano with examples built-in for both emitter and receiver. Combination of files found here: https://github.com/emakefun/emakefun-nano-plus/tree/master/RF-Nano/nRF24l01%2B/program for easy install of both emitter and receiver examples.

You'll also need to install the CH340 driver; what's available here appears to work: https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html
